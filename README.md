# DesmoStats
## About
DesmoStats is a free, login-less online statistics calculator built around a fully functional spreadsheet. Data is entered in a familiar table format, while statistical tools are accessed through structured menus, similar to desktop software like JMP.

The spreadsheet supports formulas, drag-and-fill, and importing/exporting CSV, JSON, and XLSX files. Built-in statistical tools include:
- Variable summaries
- Distributions
- Confidence intervals
- Hypothesis tests
- Plots and graphs
- Linear regression and residuals

The project began with the goal of making statistics tools accessible to students, especially AP Statistics students. A dedicated TI-Nspire mode mirrors the calculator used for the exam and in-class, matching its menus, inputs, outputs, and terminology.

The long-term vision is to grow this foundation into a higher-level statistics calculator, starting from these core features.
